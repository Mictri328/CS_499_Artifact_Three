# Project Title

Node js web application 

## Description

The final project for class was to utilize the ability to use databases. For this I created a node.js web application that utilizes Mongo Cloud to allow for data used in another project to be entered into this database. The other Project was a data mining class that provided data in a csv file. This would allow users to continue to enter and manipulate data in a web application instead of a spreadsheet. The project allows for full CRUD functionality and is stored on a cloud database so is always saved and active. 

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

Visual Studio Code

NPM 

### Installing

Install and unzip the file in Github locally to the machine you want to run it on

### Executing program

After unzipping the file open Visual studio code and import the mongo_crud file

Open the terminal and make sure you are inside the mongo_crud folder location

With tasks.json open press CTRL+Shift+B and the code will run and select you as the local host

Click the link or open a web browser and go to http://localhost:3000

From here you are logged in and able to make any changes to the form


## Help

Make sure to open terminal and confirm you are inside the correct folder with Visual Studio Code before running
